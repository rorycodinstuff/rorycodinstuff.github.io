<div class="blurb">
<p>My code artefact consists of a number of exercises completed as part of the textbook <i>Automate the Boring Stuff</i>. The book contains several guided projects in Python, as well as practice projects which require the student to draw on the concepts taught in each chapter. These Python programs have allowed me to engage in the work of my housemates, who are both currently working on more advanced projects in Python.</p>
	
<p>This website, which I have created following a tutorial and am hosting on Github, also comprises part of my final artefact. It demonstrates both an awareness of the many possible paths to code literacy, as well as an engagement with code communities through the creation of a Github account. I have uploaded the Python programs to a repository on my Github profile, which is available <a href ='https://github.com/rorycodinstuff/DSM-artefact'>here</a>.</p>

<p>All of the programs should run on Python 3.6. Where a program has been written to run from the command line, I have included the source code and .bat files in a zip file loaded to the repository. To run these files, see the file 'how-to-run-python-programs.jpg' in the repository for details.</p>

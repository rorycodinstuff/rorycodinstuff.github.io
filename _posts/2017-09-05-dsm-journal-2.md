This week, following my completion of chapter 5 of my Python textbook, I started exploring ways I could host my DSM journal reflections online. The variety of languages, frameworks and hosting services available to me are overwhelming. Kotamraju (2002, p. 18) stated 'from the moment of its emergence in the mid-1990s, web design skill immediately engaged in the process of reinvention', an assertion that still holds true fifteen years later as sites like A List Apart and Smashing Magazine report weekly on the latest web trends.

It was from the latter publication, Smashing Magazine, where I first learnt about static site generators and Jekyll. Static site generators provide a streamlined way of creating static websites - that is, websites without a database to store its content. This is in contrast to modern websites, in which content such as blog posts, images, and various metadata are stored in databases, which are pinged each time someone visits the site. Static websites are less prone to security flaws and load faster than dynamic websites (Christensen 2015).

The emphasis of performance as a key benefit of static sites reflects 'good grounds to assume the indispensability and, consequently, the priority of hardware' (Kittler 1997, p. 152). This material approach to software studies interrogates the infrastructure underlying contemporary experiences with computers. In this case, the adoption of static site generators is an implicit acknowledgement of the networked internet and its interface via browsers. Loading a website necessitates packets of data passing from the host server to the user's computer through many networked formations - 'the material frames for the possible content, the possible use(rs)' (Brugger p. 21) are contingent upon hardware for interfaces to appear coherent.

After some searching, I chose to follow [Jonathan McGlone’s guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to setting up a website hosted on open source code platform Github, powered by static site generator Jekyll. The additional benefit of this solution is that it required me to get set up in Github, home to the code projects of 25 million developers across the world (Github 2017). Dabbish et al. (2012) have found the transparency of hosted code on Github encourages learning from other developers, so the setup of my Github account and first repository - my Jekyll site - seems like a good start begin engaging with this code community and furthering my skills.

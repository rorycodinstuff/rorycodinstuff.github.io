I am due to submit my code artefact today, which involves collecting all of the Python exercises I have done so far in Sweigart's *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*. In total, I completed 12 practice projects in the book. Translated to 1 program per week, it seems like a somewhat decent effort. I am disappointed I did not reach my goal of completing the book before the end of semester - in retrospect it was a mistake to estimate the time to complete each chapter based on the first two, which were orders of magnitude easier than where I am currently at in the book. I am eager to continue working through the book beyond the course, as I can imagine how I would utilise the task automation offered by the book's later topics in terms of cleaning up my computer's files, and scraping data from websites.

Of greater concern to me is whether I can fully claim literacy in code, given that an 'interdisciplinary range of methodologies and approaches to understanding code' (Berry 2011, p. 43) are necessary to comprehend the multifaceted impact of code on the modern world. Whether examining the material dependencies of code (Kittler 1997), the dynamics of coding communities, or how code forms algorithms that can impact the representation of culture (Striphas 2015), there seems to be no end to the dimensions in which code can - and arguably should, if we are to adopt Berry's outlook - be critiqued. For every academic article or blog I cited throughout these journals, there were at least a dozen more theoretical threads wound through sociocultural strata. 

Notwithstanding analysis of the larger political and cultural effects of code, even the seemingly simplistic task of defining code breaks down in the layers of abstraction between the code I have written and the actions of my computer whenever I run a program. Should I be proud that I can add to a dictionary data type in Python source code, aware of the fact that this code goes through several translation processes that appear disembodied and arcane to me? I definitely do not have a deep understanding of every issue discussed on Stack Overflow about my code (Anderson et al. 2012), or feel I could keep up in discussion about the best modules of code other people have written for me to use in Python. 

How then am I to become code "literate", when any act of writing, running, or talking about code is entangled in an ecology of human and machine languages? At this point I have completed a cursory survey of the practices, beliefs, and infrastructures that I believe constitute aspects of code literacy. It feels like I have spent a few months living in another country - though I have picked up some of the language, customs and values of the culture, I have only scratched the surface of what it means to live in this place, both everywhere and nowhere, virtual and real.

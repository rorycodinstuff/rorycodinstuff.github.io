I created this site using Jonathan McGlone's guide to [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ "link to guide"). It took about an hour and I'm excited to build on my HTML and CSS with this site before trying to get involved in complicated stuff like JavaScript.

It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the posts are written in Markdown.

I have a minor to do list for it, including:
* Adding a custom domain
* Adding a Google Analytics tracker to the site
* Loading an image on the home page
* Tweaking CSS
* Add a link to download my CV (I guess...)

Will keep you posted.

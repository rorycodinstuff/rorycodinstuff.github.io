This week my code affected my computer in the most tangible way yet. A guided exercise in the chapter of the Python textbook involved creating randomized quizzes on US State capitals, as well as answer keys for each quiz. Running this program created 70 text files on my computer, each containing an assortment of multiple choice questions or answers. Up until this point the output of my code had been constrained to the IDLE, or perhaps the command line. My awareness of these spaces on my computer has only been within the context of learning to code, but this program had visible effects in my File Explorer! It felt amazing.

Reflecting on my wonderment of this program's outputs, I gain a personal understanding of what Chun (2008) describes as "code as fetish". In her argument, a fetish can be understood 'as "primitive causal thinking," derived causality from desire rather than reason' (Chun 2008, p. 310). The concept of the black box, from which we observe only inputs and outputs, embodies this fetishism well. My excitement was due in part to a sense of unpacking the black box - rather than simply clicking a button and watching the computer respond, I had something of a say to what was in that black box. The joy seemed to come from the novelty of subverting my fetishisation of code.

This emotional response, however, fails to fully grasp the materiality of code, and plays into the 'still lingering tendency to view informational technologies and processes in disembodied and immaterial terms' (Goddard 2015, p. 1762). To suggest the act of writing this code unveiled the inner workings of the black box I am typing from ignores the unknown lines of code comprising the library I imported at the beginning of the program, to access useful functions for producing randomised numbers. It also does not address the process of converting my source code into bytecode, the low-level language required for my program to be executed in the Python Virtual Machine. Chun (2008) notes that translation of source code to machine code is a complex procedure. It involves a deconstruction of the layers of abstraction between our source code and the binary gates that comprise our microchips.

I find this a little discouraging, but I am coming to understand my development of code literacy as something more than just learning write programs, but to gain an appreciation of the infrastructure that enables this activity. Similar to how Langlois (2005, p. 566) challenges us to understand the world wide web 'as an assemblage of technical tools, from the hardware, electric signals, algorithms, and protocols for communication to the software, interface, and sites of representation they offer', so too do I think I will need to confront my code's embedded nature within the material, the mechanisms of dislocation that hide this nature, and acknowledge that inside the black box is likely more black boxes.

My experiences with coding this week emphasised the benefits of coding socially, as I worked through the textbook exercises in the company of my housemate and my partner - the former an accomplished computer scientist, the latter finishing up a degree in computer science. I also had my first experience with regular expressions - a concept underpinning many contemporary search algorithms. This became a good opportunity to discuss with my housemates the implications of algorithmic culture on society and representation.

Striphas defines algorithmic culture as 'the use of computational processes to sort, classify, and hierarchize people, places, objects, and ideas' (Hallinan & Striphas 2016, p. 119). Regular expressions, which declare patterns for a program to search, sort and return, have long been the underlying mechanisms to search algorithms that return results based on a user's specified input (Thompson 1968). However, the algorithms constituting major search engines today like Google and Bing fail to account for the 'historical discrimination and misrepresentation' (Noble 2012, p. 41) of marginalized identities, especially for black and latina American women seeking to learn more about their collective histories. From this example we can understand algorithmic culture as operating to maintain gendered and racial inequalities through the prioritization of demeaning representations of black women in search results.

My housemate, whose work involves gathering and analysing swathes of data from social networks like Twitter, brought up the responsibilities of researchers in how they are building their datasets and the implicit biases affecting that process. This supports the idea that 'big data is suffused with interpretation and subjectivity'(Seaver 2014, p. 3), and critiquing what subject positions lie at the heart of algorithms that work with large amounts of data - as modern search engines do - is a necessary step to understanding the consequences of algorithmic culture. As it stands, all of the major tech companies are dominated by men (information is beautiful 2017), and their subjectivity is embedded in their work and their algorithms, whether they are willing to admit it or not (Coil 2017). My partner, one of few girls in her graduating cohort, is exhausted by our conversation as she has spent some four years listening to people around her deny or attempt to justify the gendered and racialized biases within tech.

I deeply valued the intellectual discussion that came about from programming alongside my housemates, but there were also tangible benefits to my understanding of the tasks at hand. A common debugging method promulgated by developers is to explain your code to someone else, as 'this will often cause you to explain the bug to yourself' (Kernighan & Pike 1999, p. 123). Not only did this technique improve my code, but I also got the opportunity to learn about the work my housemates were doing and provide a sounding board for their own debugging. Understanding code as a community practice in this manner links back to the responsibilities developers have to their wider communities in the ways they contribute to algorithmic culture.
